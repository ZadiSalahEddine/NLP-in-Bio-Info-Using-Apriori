# Topic: A method based on association rules for the identification of factors implicating thyroid cancer from a corpus labeled in English.
# 2. Description
Thyrid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer, the incidence of which has increased dramatically throughout the world over the past few decades. The reasons for this rapid increase are not yet fully understood, but available data suggest that overdiagnosis, with advances in detection methods and screening policies, is not the only factor behind the substantial increase in incidence.
This work consists in trying, from a text labeled in English, to highlight the factors that can involve this type of cancer. For this, data mining in general and association rules in particular can be a very interesting approach to solve this type of problem. The student will therefore be led to develop a method based on association rules and apply it to a labeled text. The results should allow us to better understand the factors and causes of thyroid cancer.
